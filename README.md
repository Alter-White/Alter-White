# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ivan, and I have been fascinated by information technology since childhood. My profound interest in this field led me to enroll in university, where I successfully completed the Computer Engineering faculty and earned a master's degree.

Currently, my focus lies in web technologies, and I am enthusiastic about everything related to the development of web applications and websites. My education and practical experience empower me to explore and apply new concepts in this dynamic industry, and I am always open to learning about emerging technologies and working on interesting projects.
